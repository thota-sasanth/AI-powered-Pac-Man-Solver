# Pac-Man
In this project, we solve the Pac-Man game using Artificial Intelligence techniques. We use different search algorithms and heuristics (such as DFS, BFS, A* w/ and w/o heuristics, alpha beta pruning, expectimax, etc) for solving. We also use propositional logic and inferencing through Bayes Nets to solve the game.
